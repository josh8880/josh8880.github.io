<h2>About me.</h2>

<p> 
Hi! My name is Josh and I am currently in my first year at college. I am studying Computer Science, Business, and ICT. This website will show you 
the work that I have done as well as more stuff about me. In my spare time, I play games with my main games currently being FiveM and Rust. 
I play the FiveM server <a href="https://discord.gg/PLRP">PLRP</a> and typically play Rust on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/werwolf">WereWolf
